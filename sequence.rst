Submitting Assembled and Annotated Sequences
============================================

Submitting assembled and annotated sequences to ENA requires submission of a 
Study to represent your research project.

If you have not done so already, please register a study:
   
- `Register a study <study.html>`_

Before you submit an assembled and annotated sequences, you should review the sequence 
checklists available to see if any are suitable for your submission. This checklist will 
simplify and standardise your submission so you can submit with a template spreadsheet. 
The full list of sequence checklists are available `here <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/annotation-checklists>`_.

If there are no suitable checklists available for your submission, then you will need to 
submit your sequences in EMBL flat file format.

Template sequence spreadsheets can be submitted either using the Webin Interactive 
web interface or programmatically. To submit flat files, you can submit using 
Webin-CLI or programmatically. For an overview of the three ENA submission interfaces, 
please see the `General Guide on Submitting to ENA <general-guide.html>`_.
