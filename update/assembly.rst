Updating Assemblies
===================


Updates to assemblies are performed in very similar fashion to submission of assemblies.
It is therefore sufficient to follow the guidance in the `assembly submission <assembly>`_ pages, while considering the below information.

To submit an assembly update, make sure you use the same study and sample accessions as were used in the original submission.
In fact, this study-sample pair is unique to your assembly and is the means by which you submission is recognised as an update rather than a new submission.

If your assembly did not originally include annotation, it is not possible to update your assembly with annotation.
An unannotated assembly can only be updated with new versions of the same unannotated assembly, and the same is true of annotated assemblies.

If the original assembly is already public, then the update will be made public as soon as processing is complete.
However, please be aware that this process can take some time to complete, and you should allow at least a week after successful submission for your update to be apparent.
