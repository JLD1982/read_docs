Registering Samples
===================

In order to submit sequencing or analysis data, it is important to first register your 
biological samples with ENA. Each sample in ENA represents biomaterial that a sequencing 
library was produced from.

A different sample should be registered for each sample used in the real-life sequencing 
project. These samples give context to your data so it is important to ensure the metadata 
associated with them is as extensive and accurate as possible.

It is also important to make sure the most appropriate taxonomy is used for your samples. 
Read more about ENA's taxonomy services `here <faq/taxonomy.html>`_.

Samples can be submitted one of two ways, using the Webin Interactive web interface 
or programmatically.
