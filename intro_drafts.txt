Welcome to the official documentation for European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) data submission!  We offer three ways to submit your data, all documented below. In brief:
	- Interactive Submission: submit via your browser, by filling out webforms or uploading spreadsheets
	- Programmatic Submissions: prepare your submission in XML format and submit via cURL
	- Command Line Submissions: use the official Command Line Interface to submit
If you do not expect to be submitting frequently or in large quantities, the Interactive Submission route will be likely to suit you. Groups outputting large amounts of data may benefit from being able to automate their submission through one of the alternatives.
Please note that not all operations are available through all of the above routes. View the homepage for each submission type for more information.
These pages should provide you with all the information you need to complete your submission, but if you require clarifications or wish to offer feedback, please write to datasubs@ebi.ac.uk
