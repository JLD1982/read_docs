Login Types
-----------
The Rulespace system can be accessed and managed using

1. **AAP Account**
    The Authentication, Authorisation and Profile service (AAP) provides a central identity and role management function
    for different services at EMBL-EBI and can be used by other services and organisations as required. The service
    allows the management of permissions and attributes through domains (or groups) to be coordinated in a single point
    across a range of services.

2. **Elixir Account**
    The ELIXIR Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure (AAI) enables researchers to use their home organisation
    credentials or community or commercial identities (e.g. ORCID, LinkedIn) to sign in and access data and services
    they need.

register because you register with an account you already use, like your university, ORCID or Google account.
