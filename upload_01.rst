=====================
Module 1: Data Upload
=====================

You must upload data files into your private Webin file upload area at EMBL-EBI
before you can submit the files through the Webin submission service.


Keep local copies
=================

Always keep a local copy of the uploaded files until the files have been
successfully submitted and archived. The Webin file upload area is a temporary
transit area which is not backed up and any files on the area are subject to
our fair use policy (see below).


Fair use policy
===============

ENA is a permanent and comprehensive data repository for public domain sequence
and associated information. Data submitted into this system are routed
transiently through users' private data upload areas until such time as a
submission instruction from the user, through his/her use of the Webin system,
leads to the validation of the data and the movement of files from the data
upload area into the ENA.

The data upload areas are provided as a temporary place in which data are held
while in transit. As such, they are neither intended nor suitable for any
longer-term storage of data. Such storage is provided in ENA itself. Once in
ENA, data can be released immediately following submission or can be held
confidential prior to analysis and literature publication if required.

We expect any given data file to remain in a data upload area for no longer
than 2 months before the instruction is given by the user to submit the file.
While we attempt to remind users of this policy at the 2 months time point we
reserve the right to routinely delete any data files that persist in them for
more than 2 months.

We place no absolute limit within the 2-month period on the total volume of
user data that may exist in a data upload area at any one time and are keen to
accommodate the largest submissions where possible. However, we strongly
encourage continuous data submissions where files are uploaded and submitted in
small patches of few Terabytes or less and expect that volumes would not exceed
10 Terabytes under normal circumstances. Unexpected heavy use of the data
upload areas may have an impact on other Webin users and we are grateful for
users' attention to this aspect of our fair use policy.


Upload files
============

You will upload files to your private Webin file upload area using either FTP
or Aspera protocol through the `webin.ebi.ac.uk` service. The authentication is
done using your Webin submission account name and password.

Your username resembles 'Webin-XXXXX'. Register an account or reset your
password at the [Webin login page](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/#home).


General instructions for uploading files using a FTP client
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Use your favourite ftp client. For example, `lftp` is a popular choice for
linux and Mac users.
2. Use `binary mode` for file transfers.
3. Use `webin.ebi.ac.uk` as the target host.
4. `Login` with your Webin username and password.
5. `Upload` files to your private Webin upload area.


Using Ftp command line client on Linux/Mac
------------------------------------------

1. Open a terminal and type `ftp webin.ebi.ac.uk`.
2. Enter the username and password  associated with your Webin submission
   account.
3. Type `bin` to use binary mode.
4. Type `ls` command to check the content of your drop box.
5. Type `prompt` to switch off confirmation for each file uploaded.
6. Use `mput` command to upload files.
7. Use `bye` command to exit the ftp client.


Using Ftp command line client on Windows
----------------------------------------

1. Use FTP command line client on Windows
2. Start the command line interpreter: press Win-R, type cmd, hit enter
3. Type `ftp`
4. Type `open webin.ebi.ac.uk`
5. Enter the username and password associated with your Webin submission
   account.
6. Type `bin` to use binary mode.
7. Type `ls` command to check the content of your drop box.
8. Type `prompt` to switch off confirmation for each file uploaded.
9. Use `mput` command to upload files.
10. Use `bye` command to exit the ftp client.
11. Use `exit` command to exit the command line interpreter.


Using FileZilla on Windows
--------------------------

1. Download and install [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).
   If you are not administrator of your computer then download the portable
   version of FileZilla.
2. Use the binary mode: `Transfer menu -> Transfer Type -> Binary`.
3. Use `webin.ebi.ac.uk` as the host.
4. Use your Webin username and password.
5. Click `Quickconnect`.
6. Search for the file(s) you want to upload using the tree on the left panel.
7. Create directories in your drop box (if necessary) using the tree on the
   right panel.
8. Drag and drop the files you want to upload from the lower left panel to the
   lower right panel.
9. Once your transfer is successful, close the application.


Using Aspera ascp command line program
--------------------------------------

Aspera is a commercial file transfer protocol that may provide better transfer
speeds than FTP over long distances. For short distance file transfers we
recommend the use of FTP.

Download Aspera Cli from
[here](https://downloads.asperasoft.com/en/downloads/62).

Please select the correct operating system. The `ascp` command line client is
distributed as part of the Aspera Cli in the `cli/bin` folder.

Your command should look similar to this:

```
ascp -QT -l300M -L- <file(s)> <Webin-N>@webin.ebi.ac.uk:.
 ```

The `-l300M` option sets the upload speed limit to 300MB/s. You may wish to
lower this value to increase the reliability of the transfer.

The `-L-` option is for printing logs out while transferring,

The `<file(s)>` can be a file mask (e.g. `*.cram`), a list of files or a
single file.

The `<Webin-N>` is your Webin submission account name.


Using Webin File Uploader
-------------------------

Files can be uploaded using the Webin File Uploader, a Java web start
application downloadable from
[Interactive Webin](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/):

5. Browse into the local `Upload Directory` containing the data files you wish
   to upload using the `...` button. The list of all the files contained in the
   selected directory will be displayed.
6. Choose `Override` option if you wish to replace any existing files which
   have been previously uploaded.
7. Choose `Upload Tree` option if you wish to preserve the directory structure
   when uploading files to the Webin upload area. By default, the files will be
   uploaded into the root directory
of your Webin upload area.
8. Select the files to upload. You can use the `Select All` button to select
   all the files for upload.
9. Click on the `Upload` button.

File MD5 checksums
==================

Large file transfers do not always complete successfully over the internet.

An MD5 checksum can be computed for a file before and after transfer
to verify that the file was transmitted successfully.

You must provide an MD5 checksum for each file submitted to the archive. We
will re-compute and verify the MD5 checksum to make sure that the file transfer
was completed without any changes to the file contents.

To compute the checksum for a file in Linux or Mac you can use the `md5sum`
command line program, for example:

```
md5sum a.fastq.gz
```

produces the following output containing the MD5 checksum for the file
a.fastq.gz:

```
b26854779ea34e0bc3f47219e6e079e6 a.fastq.gz
```

There are several ways to provide a file MD5 checksum to Webin:

1. If you are using the Webin File Uploader
   then the MD5 checksum will be computed automatically for each file and
   stored in a MD5 checksum file.
2. If you are using the Interactive Webin then you can provide the MD5 checksum
   in the submission spreadsheet for each file.
3. You can also store and upload the MD5 checksum in a separate file. This MD5
   checksum file must have the same name as the uploaded data file with an
   additional `.md5` suffix at the end.

In Linux or Mac the MD5 checksum file can be created by using the `md5sum`
command line program, for example:

```
md5sum a.fastq.gz > a.fastq.gz.md5
```

produces `a.fastq.gz.md5` file with the MD5 checksum and the file name:

```
b26854779ea34e0bc3f47219e6e079e6 a.fastq.gz
```


File with invalid MD5 checksum
------------------------------

If Webin detects a file with a MD5 checksum different from the one provided at
time of submissions then you will receive an e-mail notification:

![Webin error letter](images/webin_md5_error_letter.png)

There are two possible reasons for this error.

- Wrong MD5 checksum

You can check if you accidentally provided a wrong MD5 checksum by computing
the checksum for your local copy of the uploaded file and comparing it against
the MD5 checksum which you originally provided. If these MD5 checksums are
different then you can upload a new MD5 checksum file or change the MD5
checksum using [Interactive Webin](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/):

![Webin change checksum](images/webin_md5_change.png)

- File was changed during transfer

If you know that the MD5 checksum you provided at time of submission was
correct then the file transfer was not successfully completed. In this case,
please upload the file again exactly in the same location and with exactly the
same name as before.


File with invalid contents
--------------------------

There is an additional situation when you may be required to upload your file
again.

Many file formats are subjected to a format check done by Webin. Any files that
do not pass this validation are required to be replaced before the file is
accepted into the permanent archive.

For example, Webin insists that each submitted BAM file must be readable by
[Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/). If this is not the case then please correct
and re-upload the file exactly in the same location and with exactly the same
name as before. Note that a new MD5 checksum must be provided as the file
contents have changed.
