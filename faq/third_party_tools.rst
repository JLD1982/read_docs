Third Party Tools
=================

Members of the user community sometimes produce software to assist in the 
preparation and submission of files to ENA. Some go on to make these more 
widely available to other users.

The below are examples of such tools. While we had no hand in their production
and have not thoroughly reviewed them, we have heard from users of them that 
they have been valuable. 


Tools To Create ENA Flat Files
==============================

`EMBLmyGFF3 <https://github.com/NBISweden/EMBLmyGFF3>`_ is a creation of 
staff at NBI Sweden. This tool can be used to convert an assembly in FASTA
format along with associated annotation in GFF3 format into the EMBL flat file
format which is the accepted medium for submitting annotated assemblies to us.

`Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT)<http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Artemis/ACT/>`_
is a part of the Artemis Software developed at the Sanger Institute. Among 
other things, it can output your file in EMBL flat file format.

`EMBOSS Seqret <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sfc/emboss_seqret/>`_ is a tool
developed by colleagues at EBI. It can convert between many different formats
for various different molecules.
