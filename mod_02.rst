Module 2: Register a Study
==========================

This form is used to register a study (also referred to as a project). Studies are typically registered before any data is submitted.
Data can be added to the study at any time. Please see `Interactive Submission Options`_ to learn how to access it. Fill it out and click 'Submit' to register your study and receive accession numbers.
The details can be edited and updated later, but you need to have registered a study to submit your data.

Webin will report two accession numbers for the study. The first starts with PRJEB and is called the BioProject accession.
This is typically used in journal publications. The study will also be assigned an alternative accession number that starts with ERP.
This accession number is called the SRA (Sequence Read Archive) study accession.

The study and its associated data will not become public until the study release date has expired (*).
You can change this date at will should you need to release the data or delay its publication further.
However, you will no longer have this option once the data are public.

Have a look at an `example <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB1234>`_ of a study in the ENA browser.
