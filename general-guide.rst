General Guide on Submitting to ENA
==================================

Before submitting to ENA it is important to familiarise yourself with 
the different options available for data submission. This general guide 
will get you started in understanding how data can be submitted to ENA 
and how to keep track of the progress of your submission.

For general advice on the three submission services available please see
pages on interactive, Webin-CLI and programmatic submissions. For 
information on how to track the progress of your submission, see pages 
on the Webin Submissions Portal and Reports Service.

The table below outlines what can be submitted through each submission route.
It is also recommended that you familiarise yourself with our `metadata model
<general-guide/metadata.html>`_.
